(This readme is a joke. You may think that it's __painfully__ obvious due the insane amount of cringy content on it, and that this header is not required; but apparently some recruiters keep sending me job offers after reading this cursed walltext, so I guess clarifying this isn't a real job resume may unflag me from some recruit-bots) 

# Hello  World! 🌍
#### 👣 (For humans) 😀

I'm **Yahlunna** 🐰 ! I'm a computer engineer 👩‍💻 and a game developer 🎮.

I'm a humble, clever, and beautiful [furry](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/yahlunna/) bunny 🐇 who likes to code game logic for a living. I love to play competitive or challenging games, cry about [accessibility in media](https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/274413-DSD1.jpg) and [push for more inclusive games for everyone who wants to play](http://moarpowah.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Touhou-Easy-Mode.png), shitpost on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yahlunna), code [useless or stupid stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/noz6tp/bad_apple_but_it_is_rendered_in_160k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and [rickroll absent-minded people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

If you are looking for exciting projects and repos; or scouting for appealing candidates for your super chick and unique enterprise/startup: ignore this profile, this ain't a professional portfolio. Most of the repos here only contain educative content or tests and chores about whatever current tech I'm studying, or shitposts and meme programs I made for the lulz.

I hope you enjoyed stalking my profile. Have a fun day, and remember that trans rights are human rights! 🏳‍🌈

P.S: Here is a picture of [my sole](https://i.imgur.com/QjldITp.png) if you're into that kinky shit 🌶.
