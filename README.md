# Hello  World! 
#### (For humans)

I'm **Yahlunna**! I'm a computer engineer and a game developer.

I'm a humble, clever, and beautiful [furry](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/yahlunna/) bunny who likes to code game logic for a living. I love to play competitive or challenging games, cry about [accessibility in media](https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/274413-DSD1.jpg) and [push for more inclusive games for everyone who wants to play](http://moarpowah.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Touhou-Easy-Mode.png), shitpost on T[witter](https://twitter.com/home), code [useless or stupid stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/noz6tp/bad_apple_but_it_is_rendered_in_160k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [rickroll absent-minded people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

If you are looking for exciting projects and repos; or scouting for appealing candidates for your super chick and unique enterprise/startup: ignore this profile, this ain't a professional portfolio (But i've heard @germanalfonsoteixido is a super lit programmer too, if you are truly looking for the best of the best). Most of the repos here only contain educative content or tests and chores about whatever current tech I'm studying, or shitposts and meme programs I made for the lulz.

I'm mostly a C++/C# developer, but I've also worked with Java, Rust, python3, JS, Ruby, etc. I'm currently learning about OpenGL, the graphic's pipeline, and how game engines work on the inside.  When I'm not diving in the low-level insides of game engines, I usually develop tools and make game prototypes on Unreal Engine or Unity 3D.

I hope you enjoyed stalking my profile. Have a fun day, and remember that trans rights are human rights!

P.S: Here is a picture of [my feet](https://i.imgur.com/QjldITp.png) if you're into that kinky shit.
